# Development Plan — v0.3

In-progress milestones for kiso v0.3. Continues from v0.2 (all M44–M68 complete).

## Principles

- **Agile**: smallest testable increment first, then layer on
- **No dead code**: every line written is immediately reachable and testable
- **Fail loud**: missing config, broken provider, invalid input → clear error, never silent fallback
- **Tested**: every milestone adds tests. `uv run pytest` must pass before moving on.
